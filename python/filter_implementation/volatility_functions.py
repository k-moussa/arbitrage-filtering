''' Goal: This module defines the volatility functions used for "Arbitrage-Based Filtering of Option Price Data.";
    the functions depend on Peter Jackael's proposed implied volatility solver and Black function from
    "Let's Be Rational" as implemented in https://github.com/vollib/lets_be_rational
